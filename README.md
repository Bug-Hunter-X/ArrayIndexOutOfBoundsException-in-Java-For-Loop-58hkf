# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The error occurs when trying to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range of indices for that array.  Specifically, it highlights a common mistake in for-loop conditions when iterating over arrays.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected version.

This example showcases the importance of carefully checking the bounds of arrays to avoid runtime exceptions.
